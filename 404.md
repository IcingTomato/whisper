<blockquote>
No matter where you go, you should always remember: the past is false, the past can not be returned, and every disappearing spring is gone forever. The most fanatical, most faithful love is just passing away.<br>
From Gabriel José de la Concordia García Márquez <i>Cien años de soledad</i>
